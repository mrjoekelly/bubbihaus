                Honey bee, I think I’m dying out<br>
                But It’s not a crisis to lose me<br>
                You said<br> 
                A Lie by omission is still a lie<br>
                I said<br>
                How about a Mission impossible marathon<br><br>
              </div>

              <div class="line3">
                II.<br>
                If I used to love you I’ll always love you<br>
                That’s just how my mantra goes<br>
                I see you doing things you never said you’d do <br>
                Its a split end oxymoron <br>
                you gotta cut it for it to grow <br><br>

                I read something somewhere <br>
                "We don’t lie because we want to protect <br> 
                people, we lie because the capital T truth <br>
                might provoke others to make decisions <br>
                that aren’t in our interest." <br>
                 …I think it was on Facebook <br><Br>

               Honey bee, hear me crying out<br>
               It’s not so nice to abuse me<br><Br>

                V.<br>
               Hell inside out is a warm belly<br>
               Sat in a flat in London and Flicked on the telly<br>
               Saw you or what looked like you or what <br>
               looked like what I remember you to look like <br>
               cause I haven’t even-<br>
               Sorry.<br>
               I haven’t even eaten at nandos<br>
               I let my soul slip out and project to a time <br>
               where the best striker in the world was <br>
               named Fernando and me and my family took <br>
               a trip to Disney Orlando<br>
               And I felt my stomach drop out on tower of terror<br>
               Now or never<br>
               seems like a threat<br>
               I just want my stomach back<br>
               Warm belly full of cheeky chicken tenders<br>
               Remember when: Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul,<br>
               Simple Life, simpler times tables <br>
               tables spun out infinitely in all directions  <br>
               till they become the truth, <br>
               Babe Ruth was Dominican. <br><Br>

               I look down and see all blue, <br>
               I look bad in red that’s your color.<br>
               I’ve never been the lucky caller.<br> 
               Leaving messages even when I know your machine is full, <br>
               seated in the emergency exit, <br> l
               like, I need you to know what shit you pull<br><Br>

              You said see you next Tuesday<br>
              I said it’s a date<br>
              Thinking how god doesn’t really wanna get <br>
              his hands dirty<br>
              Thinking how “next time”s always come <br>
              when it’s too late.<br>
              Pray to the pope<br>
              I know he knows something. <br>
              Step on his robe,<br>
              like, lemme show you something.<br><Br>

               I hurtle through the sky at like,<br>
               1,000 miles per hour<br>
               A turtle is just a lizard with a defense mechanism<br>
               that won’t let him relax on his back.<br>
               Needless to say, sometimes I feel like that <br>
               Swerve the train and mega drift on the track, <br>
               so that I wipe out the entire trolly problem <br>
               without a trace,<br>
               face twisted like ace of bass. <br>
               Quick to race, last to lose. <br> 
               Last to lose is first place with a bad attitude.<br><Br>

               Let my body become a thorny rose <br>
               Some of you have never hurt someone <br> 
               you love and it shows.<br><Br>

               Let me coming back as a running sink.<br>
               With a cup underneath that’s always <br>
               overflowing so as to deter you from ever <br>
               taking one, tiny, little, fucking<br>

               Flushed like a shy one when you look inside me<br>
               Peel my petals back<br>
               There’s nothing in the middle<br>
               Malcolm in the middle on a lizzo leash.<br>
               Dirty texting or did I misread that lil’ peach? <br>
               Is it a reach? Is it s a reach? Is it a… <br>
