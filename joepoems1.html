                Honey bee, I think I’m dying out<br>
                but It’s no crisis to lose me.<br>
                Vines dead and the oceans drying up<br>
                but they keep making movies.<br>
                You said<br>
                "A Lie by omission is still a lie."<br>
                I said<br>
                "How about a Mission Impossible marathon?"<br><br>
              </div>

              <div class="line3">
                 II.<br>
                If I used to love you I’ll always love you<br>
                That’s just how my mantra goes<br>
                I see you doing things you never said you’d do<br>
                You need to cut it for it to grow.<br>
                That's a split end oxymoron <br>
                Even after eight seasons Fez was still foriegn.<br><br>
              </div>

              <div class="line4">
                 III.<br>
                I read something somewhere <br>
                "We don’t lie because we want to protect <br>
                people, we lie because the capital-T-Truth <br>
                might provoke others to make decisions <br>
                that aren’t in our interest." <br>
                 …I think it was on Facebook <br><Br>

                IV.<br>
               Honey bee, hear me crying out<br>
               It’s not so nice to abuse me<br>
               Top down, all my papers flying out,<br>
               GMC Sierra trailer, like, I'm saying you see through me.<br>
               You said<br>
               "Real people are not actors."<br>
               I said<br>
               "...How about a Mission Impossible marathon?"<br><br><Br>

                 <div class="line6">
                V.<br>
               Hell inside out is a warm belly.<br>
               I'm sat in a flat in London and flick on the telly,<br>
               I see you- or- what looks like you- or - what <br>
               looks like what I remember you to look like, <br>
               cause I haven’t even-<br>
               Sorry.<br>
               I haven’t even eaten at nandos.<br>
               I let my soul slip out and project to a time <br>
               where the best striker in the world was <br>
               named Fernando, and me and my family took <br>
               a trip to Disney Orlando,<br>
               and I felt my stomach drop out on the Tower of Terror<br>
               Thinking how "Now or Never"<br>
               seems like some sort of threat.<br>
               Like, I just want my stomach back.<br>
               A warm belly full of cheeky chicken tenders<br>
               Remember when: Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul,<br>
               Simple Life, simpler times tables, <br>
               tables spun out infinitely in all directions  <br>
               till they become the truth. <br>
               Babe Ruth was Dominican. <br><Br>
             </div>

                   <div class="line7">
                VI.<br>
               I look up and think of you. <br>
               I look down and see all blue. <br>
               I look bad in red, that’s your color.<br>
               Red like messages sent but not really recieved. <br>
               I hate to ask but, like, do you really know what I mean?<br>
               I mean, you nice, we get it. <br>
               Sound too can take on some kind of color,<br>
               and I’ve never been the lucky caller,<br>
               leaving voices even when I know your machine is full. <br>
               Here I am, seated in the emergency exit row, <br>
               feeling everyones doubts about if I even know <br>
               what lever to pull.<br><Br>
             </div>

                     <div class="line8">
                VII.<br>
              You said "See you next Tuesday."<br>
              I said "It’s a date."<br>
              Thinking how god doesn’t really wanna get <br>
              his hands dirty.<br>
              thinking how “next time”s always come <br>
              when it’s too late.<br>
              I pray to the pope cause<br>
              I know he knows something. <br>
              I step on his robe, like,<br>
              lemme show you something.<br><Br>
          </div>

                    <div class="line9">
                VIII.<br>
               I hurtle through the sky at, like,<br>
               1,000 miles per hour.<br>
               Thinking thats why they have co-pilots<br>
               One alone can't handle all that power.<br>
               A turtle is just a lizard with a defense mechanism<br>
               that won’t let him relax on his back.<br>
               Needless to say, sometimes I feel like that. <br>
               Swerve the train and mega drift on the track, <br>
               so that I wipe out the entire trolly problem <br>
               without a trace, bumping "The Sign" by Ace of Base.<br
               Quick to race, but last to lose. <br>
               Thinking last to lose is first place with a bad attitude.<br><Br>
            </div>

                   <div class="line10">
                IX.<br>
               When I die and I decompose, <br>
               let my body become a thorny rose. <br>
               Some of you have never hurt someone <br>
               you love and it shows.<br><Br>
            </div>

               Oh honey bee, let me go extinct,<br>
               let me come back as a running sink,<br>
               with a cup below that’s overflowing <br>
               already full of what you couldn't drink.<br><Br>
            </div>

                    <div class="line12">
                XI.<br>
               Blood red beauty when you touch me<br>
               Flushed like a shy one when you look inside,<br>
               yes, come, peel my petals back, <br>
               look through my likes. <br>
               Find mindless meandering mid-tier memes,<br>
               see there’s nothing in the middle but<br>
               Malcolm in the Middle on a Lizzo leash.<br>
               Wait, are we dirty texting or did I misread that lil’ peach? <br>
               Is it a reach? Is it a reach? Is it a… <br>
